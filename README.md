# Metaphoric - an enhanced Oric clone
Metaphoric is an Oric clone with the memory subsystem based on the OriClone-1 project and some additional features:
* Composite video output (RCA socket)
* TRRS audio-video socket for connecting "jack to 3xRCA" cable
* Footprints for both original AY-3-8912 chips and for (much cheaper) AY-3-8910 chips (or other 40-pin clones)
* Ability to use 7905 or 7805 power regulator and also to power the Metaphoric using an external +5V power supply
* Two joystick ports on the keyboard PCB — one is an IJK „Stingy” port, the other is a cursors+space joystick for games that do not support IJK but are controlled with cursors or make it possible to redefine the keys.
* Easily accessible RESET and NMI buttons on top of the keyboard.
* Easily accessible switches for changing the ROMs between Oric-1 and Oric Atmons and for disabling the IJK interface (it may interfere with the operation of printer port and it also can corrupt sound in games that do not support IJK, e.g. Manic Miner)

Details will be posted soon
